## This is a ChatGPT clone with the focus of being able to use the free tier of OpenAI API which is limited to 40,000 Tokens

1. Clone the repository to the machine.
2. npm run start:frontend (http://localhost:3000)
3. npm run start:backend (http://localhostt:8000) <-Listening to port

## It is sill underdeveloped since I am not able to use the free ier of OpenAPI. Will update once I get free access tokens.
